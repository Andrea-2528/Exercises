    <!--  The next command is an "anchor", in this case used for a link to another webpage.
          The "href" attribute specifies the destination, the "target" attribute makes the browser open a new page.
          As a good practice, the "rel" attribute is added for security reasons, even if modern browser should already take care of it.
          Notice that the "rel" attribute is needed only because of the "_blank" argument before. -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>


    <!-- The next command is same as before, but this time instead of an absolute link it's a relative link, meaning it links
         to a page of the same domain -->
    <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>


    <!-- The next command adds an image.
        The "src" attribute indicates the source of the image, with a oath RELATIVE to the current locaiton.
        (See in the "about" file how the same image is linked).
        The "alt" attribute gives a text alternative in case the image fails to load.
        The "height" and "width" attributes are a good practice, even if the image is later modified with CSS. -->
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Image of a dog" height="853" width="640">
